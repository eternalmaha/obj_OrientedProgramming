Inheritance is a critical component of Object Oriented Programming. The concept of Parent - Child relationships as shown in the InheritanceProject has taught me:
  - Inheritance shows a clear hierarchy and structure between classes
    -Person class has 1 child class: Employee && Employee has 1 child class: Faculty
      -Through inheritance, a web of relationships is revealed through child classes inheriting parent class' properties/behaviors. We can continue to expand on the number of child            classes and even add parent classes that will reveal a larger story of relationships.
  
  - Inheritance allows for much reduced code! I learened OOP keywords like "super" allow us to call the properties/behaviors of parent class as opposed to wrighting the code over again.
    We can even tighten the relationship between the parent-child relationship by overriding methods in the parent class.
